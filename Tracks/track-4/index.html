          Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride 
          And greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight
          And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair 
          As the dining room proudly presents
          Your dinner!"<br><br>
          Be our guest, be our guest
          Put our service to the test
          Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
          And we'll provide the rest
          Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres
          Why, we only live to serve
          Try the grey stuff, it's delicious
          Don't believe me, ask the dishes<br><br>
          They can sing, they can dance
          After all, miss, this is France
          And a dinner here is never second best
          Go on, unfold your menu
          Take a glance and then you'll
          Be our guest oui, our guest
          Be our guest<br><br>
          Beef ragout, cheese soufflé
          Pie and pudding, on flambé
          We'll prepare and serve with flair
          A culinary cabaret
          You're alone and you're scared
          But the banquet's all prepared
          No one's gloomy or complaining
          While the flatware's entertaining
          We tell jokes, I do tricks
          With my fellow candlesticks<br><br>
          And it's all in perfect taste that you can bet
          Come on and lift your glass
          You've won your own free pass
          To be our guest If you're stressed
          It's fine dining we suggest
          Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest<br><br>
          Life is so unnerving
          For a servant who's not serving
          He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
          Ah, those good old days when we were useful (hey Cogsworth)
          Suddenly those good old days are gone
          Too long we've been rusting
          Needing so much more than dusting
          Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills!
          Most days we just lay around the castle
          Flabby, fat and lazy
          You walked in and oops-a-daisy!<br><br>
          It's a guest, it's a guest
          Sake's alive, well I'll be blessed!
          Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
          I've had the napkins freshly pressed
          With dessert, she'll want tea
          And my dear that's fine with me
          While the cups do their soft-shoein'
          I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing<br><br>
          I'll get warm, piping hot
          Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
          Clean it up, we want the company impressed
          We've got a lot to do!
          Is it one lump or two?
          For you, our guest (she's our guest)
          She's our guest (she's our guest)<br><br>
          Be our guest, be our guest!
          Our command is your request
          It's been years since we've had anybody here
          And we're obsessed
          With your meal, with your ease
          Yes, indeed, we aim to please
          While the candlelight's still glowing
          Let us help you, we'll keep going<br><br>
          Course by course, one by one
          'Til you shout, "enough I'm done!"
          Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
          Tonight you'll prop your feet up
          But for now, let's eat up
          Be our guest
          Be our guest
          Be our guest
          Please, be our guest

          Tale as old as time
          True as it can be
          Barely even friends
          Then somebody bends
          Unexpectedly<br><br>
          Just a little change
          Small to say the least
          Both a little scared
          Neither one prepared
          Beauty and the Beast<br><br>
          Ever just the same
          Ever a surprise
          Ever as before
          And ever just as sure
          As the sun will rise<br><br>
          Tale as old as time
          Tune as old as song
          Bitter-sweet and strange
          Finding you can change
          Learning you were wrong<br><br>
          Certain as the sun
          Rising in the east
          Tale as old as time
          Song as old as rhyme
          Beauty and the Beast<br><br>
          Tale as old as time
          Song as old as rhyme
          Beauty and the Beast
