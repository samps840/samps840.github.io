            For our typography &amp; interaction class, we were given a brief: design an identity system for a theoretical conference on a topic of your choice. Then, implement the identity system in order to create all the assets necessary to market and execute your conference. 
            Every person on our team has experienced the complexities of dealing with medical care culture, and decided to empower people with medical needs by providing out-of-the-box medical experts and resources at our conference. We decided to hold our conference in Toronto, Ontario, CA and call it ‘Tonic’ as a nod to previous medical traditions and treatments.

          <div class="sectsub">Why Toronto?</div>
          <div class="bodytext">Toronto’s population is just under 6 million people. However, more than half of the city’s population is foreign-born, making it one of the most diverse cities in the world. Canada as a whole took in over 40,000 refugees in under a year and a half,  which contributes to the diverse perspectives and potential expertise in Toronto. An article from Business Insider, citing research from Mercer, claimed that Toronto is the 16th best place in the world to live. Mercer included ‘medical &amp; health considerations’ in their evaluation, including medical supplies and services. After our team evaluated the accessibility and diversity in Toronto, we knew we had found a great location for our conference.</div>
