      <h3> Project 1: Hello World </h3>
      <p>
        Hello world. My name is Sonali. I love dogs, afternoon tea, and fuzzy blankets.
        <br>
        <br>
        My favorite weather is the same as eeyore's: cloudy, rainy, and what most of the world would consider "gloomy".
        <br>
        <br>
        My favorite thing about design is the fact that you can find it absolutely anywhere. You just have to look for it.
      </p>

        <p>One of shortest stories ever written is just six words long. “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.” Despite its length, the implied story is exceptionally heartbreaking. This is because stories have a unique power over the human experience. People are hardwired to respond to stories. Stories have the power to challenge perspectives, foster empathy and understanding for others, and can either confront us with the truth, or manipulate and conflate the truth to fit a larger narrative.
          <br>
          The human brain is most comfortable in the   daydreaming state (Gottschall). People are not only most comfortable when reliving and hearing stories, but the brain experiences stories as participants rather than spectators. This sensation of participating is what creates empathy.  
          <br>
          Empathy is the process and ability to understand what someone else may be feeling or experiencing. Unlike sympathy, which is acknowledging someone else’s feelings or experiences, the evidence points to empathy making it easier to connect with someone else by attempting to feel their pain. One series of books is considered to have helped foster empathy in its readers particularly well.
          <br>
          The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling is considered a modern literary masterpiece. This is not only because of its intricate detail and creative plot, but because it also helps change readers’ negative attitudes and perspectives of others. “Reading literary fiction, as opposed to popular fiction or nonfiction, results in keener social perception and increased empathy” (Stetka). Harry Potter is a character that is confronted with people and creatures that differ from him because of their social status. Despite other characters displaying implicit bias or explicit racism, Potter uses critical thinking to decide what is right and fair. Readers are not only resonating with Potter, but also actively recognizing the kind of person that they do not want to be. “people form attitudes not only by conforming to positive relevant others, but also by distancing themselves from negative relevant others” (Stetka). The combination of presenting a complex situation in a narrative and the brain’s response to it is what makes storytelling so powerful. This response can also force people to confront negative or inaccurate beliefs and attitudes in a unique way. 
          <br>
          Documentaries are one of those things that most people watch far less often than mainstream entertainment, but usually enjoy these unique films whenever they do. Documentaries provide information alongside a narrative, allowing people to make up their own minds about an issue. At least, they think they are. In the comedic documentary, The Problem with Apu, Asian-American comic and writer Hari Kondabolu attempts to find a solution to the problem that The Simpsons character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has created for the south-asian community. The ‘fresh-off-the-boat’ character has caused a negative stereotype to plague many of the south-asian people living in the United States. This documentary uses storytelling in order to explain how this single character has created so much damage, the ignorance, and perhaps even maliciousness, that has gone into the character’s creation, and why it needs to be fixed. By watching this documentary, viewers are confronting something that they may not have even known was an issue, and just how deep that issue has run for many. This gives many non-Asian-Americans an opportunity to view the world as South Asians do, and also can give South Asians the tools to describe the harassment and discrimination they may experience.
            <br>
          Stories are, by nature, emotional experiences. When told right, stories affect the way that others, who may not be able to truly experience something first hand, empathize with the storyteller and change peoples’ minds. Stories can take many different forms, and their messages can be entertaining, informative, or both.
