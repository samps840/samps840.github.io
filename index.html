      <h3> Assignment 1: Hello World </h3>
      <p>
        Hello world. My name is Sonali. I love dogs, afternoon tea, and fuzzy blankets.
        <br>
        <br>
        My favorite weather is the same as eeyore's: cloudy, rainy, and what most of the world would consider "gloomy".
        <br>
        <br>
        My favorite thing about design is the fact that you can find it absolutely anywhere. You just have to look for it.
